# Maxlell's equation with 1D-FDTD
## Pjoject1
### Task
- Make your own 1D FDTD simulation program for electromagnetic wave propagation.
- Check if your program runs correctly.

### Tips
1. As initial conditions, E_z, B_y are 0. Give a E_z variation. Forexample, set up a Gaussian Pulse either at one boundary or at the center.

# Term
FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain): 時間領域差分 
PDE (Partial Differential Equation): 偏微分方程式
