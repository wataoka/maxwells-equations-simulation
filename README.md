# Maxlell's equation with FDTD
## Pjoject1
### Task
- Make your own 1D FDTD simulation program for electromagnetic wave propagation.
- Check if your program runs correctly.

### Tips
As initial conditions, E_z, B_y are 0. Give a E_z variation. Forexample, set up a Gaussian Pulse either at one boundary or at the center.
